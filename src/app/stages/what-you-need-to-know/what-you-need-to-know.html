  <h3>Child support and family assistance</h3>
  <p>Child support payments and Family Tax Benefit Part A are linked. A change to one payment can affect the other, even if you arrange your child support payments privately or have a child support agreement.</p>
  <p>After you separate, there’s a period of grace so you can work out parenting arrangements and apply for child support. You may not be eligible for more than the base rate of Family Tax Benefit Part A if you don’t complete and submit this application.</p>
